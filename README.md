Coffee Machine Simulation
** Overview **
This is a simple Python program that simulates a coffee vending machine. Users can choose between three types of drinks: espresso, latte, and cappuccino. The program checks if there are enough resources (water, milk, and coffee) to make the selected drink and processes coin payments. If the payment is successful, the coffee is made, and the resources are updated. The program also allows users to view resource reports and track the profit.

** Features **
Drink Options: Choose between espresso, latte, or cappuccino.

Resource Management: The program tracks available water, milk, and coffee and ensures there are enough resources before making a drink.

Coin Payment System: Users can insert coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies) to pay for the selected drink.

Transaction Handling: The program checks if the inserted money is sufficient for the drink cost and returns change if needed.

Resource Report: View the remaining resources and the total profit generated from the transactions.

** How It Works **
Select a Drink: Choose between espresso, latte, or cappuccino.

Check Resources: The program checks if there are enough ingredients (water, milk, coffee) to make the chosen drink.

Insert Coins: The user inserts coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies) to pay for the drink.

Payment Processing: If the inserted coins cover the cost of the drink, the transaction is successful, and the coffee is made.

Resource Update: The resources (water, milk, coffee) are updated after each drink is made.

Report: You can type report to view the current state of resources and the profit.
